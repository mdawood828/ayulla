# Ayulla Task

I tried my best as I can, and here are my progress.

User Authentication:
	Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out of the system and
	Password recovery features
	Passwords should be securely stored and hashed using Django's built-in
	authentication system.

I'm also learnin Cryptocurrency, Wallet, and Referral System, hope I'll do it.
